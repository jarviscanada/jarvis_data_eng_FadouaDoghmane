# Fadoua Doghmane . Jarvis Consulting

I am a Software Engineering graduate with hands-on experience in data integration, workflow automation, and analytics. Through my roles at CrucialLogics and BRP, I have built integrations using REST APIs, automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps to synchronize data between tools, designed Power BI dashboards, and delivered actionable data quality insights using SQL and Snowflake. I am passionate about leveraging data to improve processes, generate insights, and enable informed decision-making. I am seeking developer or data-focused engineering roles where I can apply my problem-solving skills, technical foundation, and ability to quickly learn and deliver solutions.
