summary: >
  I am a Software Engineering graduate from Concordia University with hands-on experience in data analytics, workflow automation, and data reporting. In my roles at CrucialLogics and BRP, I developed integrations using REST APIs, automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps to synchronize data across systems, designed Power BI dashboards, and delivered actionable data quality insights using SQL, DAX, and various databases. I am currently working at Jarvis, where I develop data pipelines, analyze and visualize data using Python, Bash, and SQL, and build scalable solutions leveraging Docker, PostgreSQL, and Linux-based environments. I am passionate about using data to improve processes and uncover insights. I am seeking data-focused engineering roles where I can apply my problem-solving skills, strong technical foundation, and ability to quickly learn and deliver effective solutions.

jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: >
      Developed a lightweight Linux monitoring agent using Bash, Docker, crontab, and PostgreSQL to collect and store hardware specifications and real-time usage metrics across multiple Rocky Linux hosts. Implemented automated data collection scripts, containerized the PostgreSQL backend, scheduled recurring metric gathering with crontab, and built analytics queries to monitor system performance and resource utilization.

  - name: "Python Data Analytics Project"
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: > 
      Analyzed LGS retail transaction data to provide actionable insights for revenue growth, customer retention, and marketing optimization. Set up a PostgreSQL data warehouse (OLAP) from MS SQL Server transactional data via Docker. Performed data wrangling, monthly metrics calculations, and RFM analysis using Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib) to segment customers and evaluate value. Delivered Jupyter notebooks, SQL queries, plots, and RFM tables for actionable insights. 

highlighted_projects:
  - name: "AI-Powered Waste Sorting"
    description: >
      Developed an AI-powered waste classification system using Python and PyTorch to automate sorting across ten waste categories and support sustainable recycling practices. Built a full machine-learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, augmentation, visualization, and training of CNN architectures such as MobileNet, ResNet50, and VGG16. Created modular notebooks and scripts for reproducible training, evaluation, and deployment on sample datasets, demonstrating scalable performance and actionable insights for real-world waste management.
  - name: "Food Assistance Analytics (Hackathon)"
    description: >
      Developed analytical dashboards in Power BI to evaluate the distribution efficiency of Montreal’s food assistance programs. Collected, cleaned, and transformed data from multiple sources to produce reliable reporting outputs. Designed interactive visualizations to reveal usage patterns, highlight underserved areas, and monitor resource allocation. Interpreted findings to deliver actionable recommendations, improving program reach and operational effectiveness while demonstrating the impact of data-driven decision-making on social program optimization.
  - name: "Emotion-Detector-CNN"
    description: >
      Collaborated in a team of three to develop a CNN for detecting emotions from facial expressions. Prepared and refined the dataset through cleaning, labeling, augmentation, and visualization, and implemented multiple CNN variants to classify emotions such as happy, focused, surprised, and neutral. Applied k-fold cross-validation for evaluation and mitigated age- and gender-related dataset bias through re-labeling and retraining. Produced comprehensive documentation covering data provenance, preprocessing, model design, evaluation, and bias-mitigation strategies.
